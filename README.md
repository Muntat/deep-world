# What is this project and who is it for?


this project starts from a simple programm like hello-world and goes on to the deep parts and discuses how hello-world is working and what made it
works for example what standards are aggreed on to get to writting hello-world portably and with a lot of programming languages
and so on to the very deep parts of what are the laws of physics that you need to know to make it.
this project attempt to be sort of tutorial about the deep parts that if you want to understand you have to look a lot and take a lot of time so I made a tutorials and refrences to a lot of useful links.
